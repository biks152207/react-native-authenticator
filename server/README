simple-plist has a broken plist submodule. to fix it, delete the simple-plist/node_modules/plist directory, then clone
  https://github.com/akofman/plist.js

then plist.js to plist

The bug in simple-plist/plist is that empty values in an Info.plist will not get written out

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string/>

the value is a <string/>, and when it gets written out it will dissappear.
